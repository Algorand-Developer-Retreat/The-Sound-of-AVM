# Algorand TypeScript array usage

- Do:
   - Use immutable arrays with explicit type annotations
      - Declare with array literal syntax: `const myArray: uint64[] = [1, 2, 3]`
   - Use spread operator for "mutations"
      - Instead of push: `myArray = [...myArray, newValue]`
   
- Don't:
   - Don't mutate arrays directly (push, pop, splice)
   - Don't use array methods that modify the array in place
   - Don't use array.map
   - Don't use array.forEach
