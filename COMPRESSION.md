first step, shorten all variables to one or two letters:
```{
    "activeSynths": "aS" [
	    {
            "id": "id",
			"config": "c" {
                "type": "t",
				"subt": "st",
                "parameters": "p"
			},
            "settings": "ss" {
                "oscillator": "o" {
					    "type": "t"
				}, 
                "envelope": "e" {
                    "attack": "a",
                    "decay": "d",
                    "sustain": "st",
                    "release": "r",
				},
                "volume": "v",
				"muted": "m" { 
				    "boolean: 1 or 0"
					},
				"pitch": "pt",
				"delay": "dy" {
					"time": "tm",
					"feedback": "f",
					"wet": "wt"
				},
				"reverb": "rb" {
					"decay": "d",
					"wet": "wt"
				],
				"lfo": "l" {
					"rate": "rt",
					"depth": "dp",
					"waveform": "w",
					    "sine": "sn",
						"square": "sr",
						"triangle": "tr",
						"sawtooth": "sw"
					"destination": "dn"
				},
				"noteDuration": "nd",
				"baseNote": "bn",
				"sequence": "sq" [],
				"currentStepIndex": "si"
				}
			}
		}
}```

But that's not enough:


I'm trying to reduce the filesize of this json even further!




Compressed JSON - Strategy 1: Short Keys
Code 
removes whitespace and null values, but that's not enough. we need more aggressive techniques:


<!-- Compressed JSON - Strategy 2: Ultra-Short Keys + Defaults
Code 


Ultra-Compressed JSON - Under 1KB
Code 

Array format: Converted objects to arrays with fixed positions
Integer scaling: Multiplied decimals by 100 and stored as integers (0.17 → 17)
Removed redundant data: Eliminated repeated null values and defaults
Oscillator encoding: 0=sine, 1=square, 2=sawtooth, 3=triangle
Compressed IDs: Sequential numbers instead of long strings
To decode this back to your original format, you'd need a mapping like:

Position 0: ID
Position 1: Type
Position 2: Oscillator type (0-3)
Position 3-6: ADSR envelope (scaled by 100)
Position 7: Volume (scaled by 100)
And so on...
Alternative approaches if you need even smaller:

Use base64 encoding of binary data
Implement custom compression algorithm
Remove non-essential parameters entirely
Use shorter note names (D1→13, G4→67, etc.)
The ultra-compressed requires a decoder.

One synth becomes something similar to this: [1,0,0,17,20,50,13,-16,0,19,18,100,15,30,138,74,3,"dytm",16,"D1",[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],4]

New size: ~85-90 bytes per synth

But is that enough?

An algorand arc0003 nft has these limitations:

Sender: 32 bytes (Algorand address)
Asset Name (an): up to 32 bytes Assets Overview
Unit Name (un): up to 8 bytes Assets Overview
Total Supply (t): 8 bytes (uint64, value between 0 and 2^64-1) Algorand Ledger Spec
Metadata Hash (am): exactly 32 bytes (SHA-256 digest of the JSON metadata file) ASA Constraints -->
